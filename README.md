# Lambda Typescript Template

This is a template repo for creating lambda functions using typescript. We are using the serverless pattern [API Gateway HTTP API to Lambda](https://serverlessland.com/patterns/apigw-lambda) using [AWS SAM](https://aws.amazon.com/es/serverless/sam/).

 It has the following features:

 * Uses typescript 
 * We use eslint for best practices
 * Uses ts-node for local development
 * Its integrated with Visual Studio Code for debugging 
 * It uses Github Actions for CI/CD workflows
 * It uses Mocha for unit testing
